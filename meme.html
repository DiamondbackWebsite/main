      <h2>A MEME STORY</h2>
<p data-p-id="0e390f8d0bb3425404d470bca0d09082">One quiet night, Dennis was sleeping peacefully in his bed. He was all cozy under the blankets, dreaming happy nerd dreams. He woke with a start to a loud crunch.  He looked around the room, but couldn't see a thing in the darkness. He started to get scared, as the crunching grew louder and louder. Luckily he kept a 6 foot metal pole under his bed in case of this exact situation. Soon enough, the crunching got so loud it was almost unbearable. Dennis got very sweaty. He looked around again, but he couldn't see anything. It was just too dark. He reached under his bed to reach the pole, so he could beat the shit out of the intruder/thing whatever it was. As soon as he reached under, he felt warm, soft skin. Dennis quickly retracted his hand.<br>"GOT ANY GUACAMOLE??????" Clockwork said, darting out from under his bed, munching a freshly fried batch of tortilla chips. </p>
                            <p data-p-id="edfb7392fa9f50ead0b2c820fc5252ca">"This shit again?" Dennis said, exasperated.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="5cbf7686db1cae79c6af4da84c22871c">"Yup!" Natalie giggled.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="44a6ce50747aea01a5fadcbfa35137f8">"What the hell are you doing here?"</p>
                            <p data-p-id="994a831300d8ab16f600c0f99f2f8756">"Well I've been living under your bed for a while now, so we can be together again!"</p>
                            <p data-p-id="9ca3a1fede8539760a508d4acebbb9fa">Even though Dennis loved Natalie a lot, he didn't appreciate her living and installing a deep fryer under his bed. But he still let it slide bc y not. Natalie angrily retreated to her little home under Dennis' bed.<br>A few weeks went by, and Natalie started acting weirder, one night, In the middle of the night dennis felt someone lie down in his bed next to him. He turned to see none other than his busty brunette babe clockwork, lying next to him. She quickly got up, straddled him, and shoved him back against the pillow. </p>
                            <p data-p-id="918e33997f4d1db0319739bd11e14fad">"Well that was fucking rude." Dennis said, sleepily, giving her attitude.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="36c7831630a0f3f52d32b22370437908">"W?H?A?T??" she said, a bit of seething anger becoming evident in her tone.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="fe09cab42ae013f3d140e2893b9a7aa5">Before long, she had drawn a large kitchen knife and Dennis was totally defenseless without even his pants to save him. Also it was like 3:12 in the morning. Natalie pulled him out of bed, lunged at him, grabbing his throat and pinning him against the nearest wall. <br>"W-w-woah. Time out give me a second I'm not even fully awake yet" Dennis said, yawning. <br>She laughed maniacally as she held him there at trusty-kitchen-knife-point and watched him struggle, gasping for breath. <i>Is this the end? </i>H*ck no we just getting started.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="b01281816bc840f4c2b17b750780efbb">The room was pitch dark. The only thing Dennis could see was the faint glow emulating from the clock on Natalie's eye. Dennis reached for the light switch, and flicked it on. She let him go, startled by the sudden lighting change. Dennis was about to Get The Hell Out Of There, but as he ran for the door, he realized his family was asleep and didn't want to be rude. <br>He figured that the next best option was to simply let Natalie stay the night <i>on</i> his bed and not under it (; (; so he used his charm and great hair to woo the psycho babe, even though that's not quite his type he was in the market for a gf. </p>
                            <p data-p-id="37abee4ebe99c9fa0526910904b6ea68">They started to kiss passionately. As Dennis peeled off her clothes like a sexual erotic potato peeler, he looked her deep in the clock eye/ regular eye.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="9dfdd5425e87ed1ec3250035bd605582">"Natalie. I love you, and even though you've tried to killed me today, I will never ever hurt you." He said with heaps of sentiment in his voice.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="ebf5665858760bdc8b33b687fc3cbdf3">"(☞ﾟ∀ﾟ)☞" Natalie said, clearly reciprocating the emotion. Dennis pondered for a moment how Natalie could speak an emoticon out loud. Things got real NC-17 real quick and before he knew it Dennis jammed his meat roast into her crock pot, and they had very intense and very explicit sex for like five minutes before collapsing on the bed.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="02224e6115fe5935282ce674e019d08c">"Wow, that was so hot" Natalie said, gasping for breath. Dennis nodded in agreement. Even though it was not hot at all because Dennis is lame. It was probably lukewarm at best. </p>
                            <p data-p-id="b5afd0da1ce517cd4f31add61ab70442">"I love you so much sweaty" Natalie said, kissing his forehead. Dennis actually was very sweaty. Almost like a steamed broccoli.</p>
                            <p data-p-id="724723aa03125932a7dae2729ece029d">Dennis was so excited he passed out. When he woke up, he was all alone and there was a piece of notebook paper taped to his fine Swedish ass.</p></pre>
