            <div class="col-xs-12 lead"><p>Legend of the Overlord: Season 1 started out as a more average survival series, but as the episodes progressed, it became more of an adventure.</p><p><br></p><p>Season 1 consists of 20 episodes, each being around 30 minutes in length.</p><p><br></p><p>The first episode was filmed on July 13, 2015, with an air date of October 9, 2015.</p><p>The series was originally discussed during June of 2015, with out even a clue of the name. The series was not planned much, all of episode 1 was improvised, along with most of the episodes until towards the end of season 1. Early evidence of starting to plan can be found at&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsSaJnUsmno" target="_blank">this link</a>. However, this world was never used as it was mainly messed around on.</p><p>The behind the scenes of episode 1 can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jnl-FUy4YIM">here</a>.</p><p>Earlier plans for the series were to have Drew be an Overlord Minion, hence why he is helping Mike and Jason in the Behind the Scenes of Episode 1. During those episodes, Drew had been using the /skin command and put one of his friend's skins on, as the current skin he had was an old skin for what would be an Overlord Minion. These plans changed as the series progressed and the idea of Drew being an Overlord Minion was scrapped. More plans were to have Quirbit be a supporter of the Overlord, which goes along with the earlier plans of having more people be on different sides, as opposed to the later plans for almost everyone to be against the Overlord.</p><p><br></p><p>The final episode of season one was filmed on April 1st, 2016. However, it was not the first time the episode was filmed. A few months prior, a different version was filmed. The original version was filmed on 1.8, and had generally the same plot, with some extra scenes and mistakes, most notably at the Overlord's base towards the end. This early version can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMDsqtYoWqs" target="_blank">here</a>. The earliest render of the Overlord vs. Magician ending scene can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDCF32mVhs" target="_blank">here</a>. This scene was also later recreated to fix some mistakes and adjust the timing.</p><p>Over time while editing, Drew exported various renders as previews.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vMDsqtYoWqs" target="_blank">March 3, 2016</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T5xNYUX3OsQ" target="_blank">April 19, 2016</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWeVS3RKOrQ" target="_blank">July 18, 2016</a></li><li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6FyuD-2I7zM" target="_blank">Official Upload - November 26, 2016</a></li></ul></div>
