	  <h2>Legend of the Overlord - Season 1</h2>
      <p>Legend of the Overlord (or LOTO) is a Minecraft roleplay series that mostly stars Diamondback, EBroGames, DrewC5131(GamesawDrew), Chipmunk, and Quirbit. They are divided into two sides, good and evil, with the evil being controlled by the mysterious figure known as the Overlord. The point of the series is to explore and survive in the land called the Overworld, discover hidden secrets, and save the world from the Overlord.</p>

		<h3>The downfall of the Overlord</h3>
        On May 15, 2016, we decided to cease all development, planning, and filming of Legend of the Overlord Season 2.
        The reasoning for Legend of the Overlord Season 2 being cancelled is because of many complications with the servers / modpack, and many delays and timing issues.
        Timing for recording was tight and almost impossible to get any episodes done. It was only really possible to record every other Saturday, which caused many issues and delays of filming. Many times, Mike (Chipmunk), who plays very important roles in LOTO, wouldn't be available to record, causing episodes to be delayed many times. As of May 15, 2016, only two episodes of season 2 have been filmed, the first being in the middle of April, and the second being in the beginning of May.
        There were also many complications with the servers / modpacks. The server world map had to be reset and reconstructed at least 4 times, due to the world being corrupted for unknown reasons. One example of a glitch that happened was one chunk in our second to last reconstruction of the map, creepers would just keep duplicating and spawning, creating thousands of creepers in one area and causing tons of lag. This error was caused by a corrupted chunk that may have possibly been corrupted because of a hard drive error due to a power outage. This was just one of the many errors that we had come across when settings up LOTO Season 2. LOTO season 2 had been in development much before season 1 had finished being filmed. The final version of the map, the one used in the 2 recorded episodes, had been created some time between March 5th (When the last map was scrapped) and March 9th (The date of the first piece of evidence of that world, was created), causing months of work on season 2 to have been lost multiple times.

	  <h3>The return of the Overlord</h3>
        On June 19, 2016, we had all talked about seeing if we could give Legend of the Overlord Season 2 one last try.
		We came to the conclusion that we will give Legend of the Overlord Season 2 another attempt. Legend of the Overlord Season 2 will be much
		more interesting and fun for us to record. Drew will still be uploading a video showing development on the scrapped season 2 content. It will be visible on this
		page once it has been uploaded.
